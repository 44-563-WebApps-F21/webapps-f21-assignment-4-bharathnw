    <h3>The Duchess of Padua</h3>
    <h4>
        _A state room in the Ducal Palace_, _hung with tapestries representing
        the Masque of Venus_; _a large door in the centre opens into a corridor
        of red marble_, _through which one can see a view of Padua_; _a large
        canopy is set_ (_R.C._) _with three thrones_, _one a little lower than
        the others_; _the ceiling is made of long gilded beams_; _furniture of
        the period_, _chairs covered with gilt leather_, _and buffets set with
        gold and silver plate_, _and chests painted with mythological scenes_.
        _A number of the courtiers is out on the corridor looking from it down
        into the street below_; _from the street comes the roar of a mob and
        cries of_ ‘_Death to the Duke_’: _after a little interval enter the Duke
        very calmly_; _he is leaning on the arm of Guido Ferranti_; _with him
        enters also the Lord Cardinal_; _the mob still shouting_.

        Shut that door there; this morning air is cold.
