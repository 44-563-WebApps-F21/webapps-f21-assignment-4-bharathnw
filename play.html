    <h3 class="name">The Duchess of Padua</h3>
    <h4>
        _A state room in the Ducal Palace_, _hung with tapestries representing the Masque of Venus_; _a large door in the centre opens into a corridor of red marble_, _through which one can see a view of Padua_; _a large canopy is set_ (_R.C._) _with three thrones_,
        _one a little lower than the others_; _the ceiling is made of long gilded beams_; _furniture of the period_, _chairs covered with gilt leather_, _and buffets set with gold and silver plate_, _and chests painted with mythological scenes_. _A number
        of the courtiers is out on the corridor looking from it down into the street below_; _from the street comes the roar of a mob and cries of_ ‘_Death to the Duke_’: _after a little interval enter the Duke very calmly_; _he is leaning on the arm
        of Guido Ferranti_; _with him enters also the Lord Cardinal_; _the mob still shouting_.
