        <h3>The Duchess of Padua</h3>
        <h4>
            _A state room in the Ducal Palace_, _hung with tapestries representing
           the Masque of Venus_; _a large door in the centre opens into a corridor
           of red marble_, _through which one can see a view of Padua_; _a large
           canopy is set_ (_R.C._) _with three thrones_, _one a little lower than
           the others_; _the ceiling is made of long gilded beams_; _furniture of
           the period_, _chairs covered with gilt leather_, _and buffets set with
           gold and silver plate_, _and chests painted with mythological scenes_.
           _A number of the courtiers is out on the corridor looking from it down
           into the street below_; _from the street comes the roar of a mob and
           cries of_ ‘_Death to the Duke_’: _after a little interval enter the Duke
           very calmly_; _he is leaning on the arm of Guido Ferranti_; _with him
           enters also the Lord Cardinal_; _the mob still shouting_.

            DUKE<br>

            The devil take her!<br>

            GUIDO [_still at the window_]<br>

            And followed by a dozen of the citizens<br>
            Has come into the Palace.<br>

            DUKE [_starting up_]<br>

            By Saint James,<br>
             Our Duchess waxes bold!<br>

            BARDI<br>

             Here comes the Duchess.<br>

            DUKE<br>

            Shut that door there; this morning air is cold.<br>

                                  [_They close the door on the corridor_.]<br>

            [_Enter the Duchess followed by a crowd of meanly dressed Citizens_.]<br>

            DUCHESS [_flinging herself upon her knees_]<br>

             I do beseech your Grace to give us audience.<br>

            DUKE<br>

             What are these grievances?<br>
